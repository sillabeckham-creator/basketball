# NBA Stats Web (Teams & Players)

Simple React + Vite frontend that uses the free balldontlie API to list NBA teams, players, and show season averages for players.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs on Vite's default port (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes
- Data source: https://www.balldontlie.io/
- This is a minimal demo. If you want a backend proxy, caching, or expanded stats, I can add that next.
